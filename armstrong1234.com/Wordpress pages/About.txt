<h2>ABOUT ARMSTRONG: KEEPING QUALITY &amp; TECHNOLOGY AT THE FOREFRONT</h2>
[/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height="20px"][vc_column_text el_class="armstrongParagraph"]
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since its inception in California in 1966 Armstrong has been committed to the improvement, beautification, and preservation of Bay Area homes and commercial and institutional buildings. This has been achieved employing an elsewhere vanishing work ethic, coupled with superior technical knowledge using only the highest quality materials and modern equipment. Perhaps most significant of all, Armstrong has maintained its position of leadership by adhering tenaciously to one of the most fundamental principles of all business transactions: listening to and pleasing our customers.</p>
