When Armstrong’s founder, Howard, received his Californian state license number (lic#245291), he opened his first location in Oakland and his second, in San Francisco, the City by the Bay. Initially, in 1966, our company’s main focus was painting and coating but soon after that our expertise and services also included windows and roofing. The classic phone number, 777-1234, wasn't adopted until years later.</span>

The stunning Victorian Homes and better known landmarks were an important starting point for the company. These structures were representative of the high quality and detailed work Armstrong would later become famous for. The iconic Painted Ladies, the Cliff house and Emilio's, for example, were some of the first San Francisco calling cards that would help Armstrong build a highly regarded reputation in the city and rest of the Bay Area.

The ubiquitous San Francisco fog posed a unique opportunity to test new paint and painting application methods which our company always strove to utilize in order to provide the best possible results for our customers. The challenges posed by this harsh paint environment would require a higher level of specification for the paint to perform properly.  Therefore, Armstrong was constantly trying to utilize the best products available to achieve desired results.

In the 1970's, lead pigment paint was starting to be phased out due to health issues and the passage of the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act.  As the toxic lead paint was being replaced with the new acrylic based paints, which are still in use today, Armstrong worked closely with several of the country's largest painting manufacturers to develop the proper protocol for applying paints to wooden structures in order to maintain the high standard of quality our customers had come to expect from us.

In addition, San Francisco stucco, asbestos tile and concrete structures faced their own set of unique challenges. Howard, along with the founder of Tex-Cote USA, helped deal with the ongoing problem of moisture infiltration with the revolutionary coating material that allowed for these stubborn surfaces to breathe. Prominent organizations such as Home Depot, NASA and Apple Computers recognized the effectiveness of the Tex-Cote coating and applied it on their own buildings to keep their maintenance hustles and costs to a minimum.

It is certain that we would all agree that San Francisco has its own undeniable style. Flat roofs are a common feature of the homes in San Francisco and, in general, the Bay Area.  As one of the premier roofing companies, Armstrong was aware, years ago, of the need to find a method and material that would offer flat roofs more than a few years protection. Consequently, when <a href="http://www.armstrong1234.com/foam-roofing/">Spray Polyurethane Foam or SPF</a> was made available over 30 years ago, we were one of the first companies to provide it to our customers. SPF roofing would ultimately become the highest standard for protecting these San Francisco treasures. Water tight, long lasting and insulating, foam roofing raised the level of protection enormously and offers 500% more energy efficiency than standard (and inferior) materials such as tar and gravel.

Along with the vibrant colors and architecture of San Francisco and Bay Area buildings, the windows have also contributed tremendously to the creation of a unique aesthetic character. Today, San Francisco has strict city codes regarding window styles and material which must be adhered to by anyone planning to add or replace his/her windows.  Armstrong is proud to help continue maintain the beauty of San Francisco homes and preserve this distinctive look by offering windows that meet the current requirements of San Francisco building codes.
