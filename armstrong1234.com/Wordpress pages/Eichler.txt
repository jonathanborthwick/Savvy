<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eichlers: The Bay Area’s Enduring Love Affair</span></h2>
[/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space][vc_column_text]
<h3><span style="color: #000000;">Joseph Eichler: "A Practical Visionary"</span></h3>
<span style="color: #000000;">Those of us fortunate enough to live in the Bay Area recognize it as a splendidly unique place, due to its natural beauty, man-made structures and, of course, the remarkable people who call it home.  It’s no wonder Joseph Eichler, one of the most innovative, forward-thinking developers of the 20</span><sup><span style="color: #000000;">th</span></sup><span style="color: #000000;"> Century, built many of his ground-breaking design homes in the Bay Area.  Our founder Howard once said, ‘One of the greatest gifts is to be "a practical visionary."’ This ideal describes Joseph Eichler perfectly, since he was a visionary who created affordable, functional and stylish homes.  With their flat roof, Mid-Century Modern design, Eichlers incorporate an open-concept floor plan with floor-to-ceiling glass windows to create an indoor-outdoor living space, placing one in harmony with the environment while retaining an optimal sense of privacy.</span>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;">Creations Of Timeless Beauty And Value</span></h3>
<span style="color: #000000;">Initially, the Eichler's extremely refined design was not well-received, but today their beauty is revered. The Eichler is so esteemed that Green Gables and Greenmeadow developments in Palo Alto were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.  With a 50 year average built age, Eichler's now require various home improvements to keep them looking as good as the day they were built. As Eichler specialists, we’re aware that the Achilles’ heel of these treasures are their elegant roofs, always incorporating flat sections that are open to the living space below, making the Eichler prone to standing water and lacking proper insulation.</span>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;">The Solution For Eichlers’ Roofing Issues</span></h3>
<span style="color: #000000;">Fortunately, the owners of these marvels need not be concerned, since their Mid-Century modern roofs can be transformed into energy efficient, moisture resistant homes.  This can be affordably achieved with the installation of Armstrong's </span><span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://www.armstrong1234.com/foam-roofing/">Spray Polyurethane Foam (SPF)</a></span><span style="color: #000000;">, which has now been tested and proven for over 35 years. The SPF Roofing System is highly recommended by organizations like the Eichler Network, whose primary aim is to preserve the purity and integrity of the Eichler.  Armstrong, was the Bay Area's original provider of<strong> </strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://www.armstrong1234.com/residential-foam-roofing/">Residential Foam Roofing</a></span><span style="color: #000000;"> because decades ago we recognized that SPF roofing was far and away the best option for protecting and adding value to flat and low slope roofs. Armstrong's expertly installed foam roofing provides un-paralleled  waterproofing, insulation and air sealing  in a single application, thus enabling owners to retain the Eichler's aesthetic qualities. Five times more energy efficient than conventional built up, modified or single ply roofing materials, an Armstrong's SPF Roof provides a seamless weatherproof barrier against water and microbe damage. </span>

<h3><span style="color: #000000;">The Documented Benefits Of SPF</span></h3>
<span style="color: #000000;">The US Energy Department recommends foam roofing for flat Eichler-type roofs since the light colors of our AWS Coatings reflect harmful UV solar rays creating a ‘cool roof’. Cool Roofs can lower rooftop temperatures by as much as 50°F — resulting in much lower utility bills and more interior comfort during our hot summer months.  In addition, SPF’s extremely tough, durable and long-lasting nature classifies it as a 50 year sustainable roofing system requiring only periodic recoating of its uppermost UV layer.  </span>
