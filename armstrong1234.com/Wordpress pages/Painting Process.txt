These materials required a renewed focus on surface preparation and extensive knowledge of primers, sealers and finish coat formulations. Unlike oil based materials which adhered to the substrate by means of penetration, waterborne coatings form a surface film which attach to the underlying substrate through chemical bonding. What this means is that surfaces must not only be prepped properly, but the type and quality of primers, sealers and caulks are paramount, since latex paints and coatings are only as durable as their weakest link. In order to guarantee maximum life-cycle performance Armstrong's focus shifted from specifying the "best paint" to full system specification. This specification process was introduced by Armstrong in the mid '90s as the AWS Painting and Coating System.

During that time and in the decades to follow, manufacturers and contractors would struggle to keep pace with the ever-changing environmental VOC mandates. Solid content, pigment volume concentration and other key aspects of paint formulation were in constant flux, which necessitated Armstrong's reliance on its own internal field performance assessments. With over 20,000 installed painting and coating jobs, Armstrong has been the recipient of  a wealth of dynamic real world data. This data is not based on weatherometers or laboratory guesstimates, but on actual performance of real houses in Northern California exposed to temperature extremes, moisture, salt air and ultraviolet degradation. After being assessed and analyzed, this data becomes part of a feedback loop which forms the foundation of our Application, Warranty and Specification (AWS) process. By being attentive to these details, Armstrong is able to offer our clients optimum life-cycle performance as well as the longest and most comprehensive warranties in the industry.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row row_type="row" use_row_as_full_screen_section="no" type="full_width" angled_section="no" text_align="left" background_image_as_pattern="without_pattern" css_animation=""][vc_column width="1/2"][vc_empty_space height="20px"][vc_column_text el_class="armstrongParagraph"]

The key to excellence in painting is preparation, preparation and more preparation. That’s where Armstrong shines. Here is an overview of our exterior painting process, including the steps, procedures and materials that are the cornerstone of the AWS Custom Exterior Painting System.

[/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height="40px"][vc_accordion active_tab="false" collapsible="yes" style="accordion"][vc_accordion_tab title="Perform a lead based paint screening survey on structures built prior to 1979."][vc_column_text]Armstrong performs a thorough site survey before we do any work. If your home was built prior to 1979, we’ll perform a lead based screening survey utilizing a multipoint XRF lead detection test. This superior test with pinpoint accuracy provides for increased lead safety on the job..[/vc_column_text][/vc_accordion_tab][vc_accordion_tab title="Hydrowash your home's exterior or building to remove dirt, chalk, lose material and grease. Mildew wash is done as needed."][vc_column_text]If lead is present some hand scraping and prep work may be done prior to the hydrowash. Pressure washing cleans the surface but in most cases is not a substitute of hand preparation.[/vc_column_text][/vc_accordion_tab][vc_accordion_tab title="Check for and reset popped nails and re-nail any loose lumber as needed."][/vc_accordion_tab][vc_accordion_tab title=" Prep Surface."][vc_column_text]Wire brush, scrape or sand wood, stucco and wood walls as necessary to remove loose material and feather remaining edges. While this step can’t make old substrates look new, many painters skip it completely.[/vc_column_text][/vc_accordion_tab][vc_accordion_tab title="Patch cracks and voids in stucco and wood walls as necessary to make them less visible."][vc_column_text]Here’s a key difference between Armstrong and other painters:
Armstrong applies AWS specified wood fillers and stucco patch that provides attractive and long-lasting protection. Many painters commonly apply spackle directly to bare wood. Spackle is cheap, covers well and is easy to work with; the problem is that spackle cracks, absorbs water and does not last. Poorly done stucco patches crack at joints, comes loose and over time can fall out.[/vc_column_text][/vc_accordion_tab][vc_accordion_tab title="Apply AWS flexible elastomeric caulk around doors and windows to seal all openings as necessary."][vc_column_text]Armstrong uses elastomerics that stretch 100% of their length or greater and then fully recover. Using the correct material around openings not only provides added protection from moisture intrusion but adds longevity to the adjacent film coating and results in a better looking job overall.
For larger cracks, Armstrong can specify polyurethanes for superior adhesion and protection. We’ll also pay special attention to cracks that might be best left open such as the bottom of windows or lap siding. Caulking these joints might actually trap water and cause damage.[/vc_column_text][/vc_accordion_tab][vc_accordion_tab title="Remove and replace any loose glazing putty materials in wood windows."][vc_column_text]We’ll prime as needed. In wood windows, putty can dry out, become loose and fall out. Water can get to the wood frame and cause damage to the window. Putty that’s tight is left in place but all loose putty will be replaced.[/vc_column_text][/vc_accordion_tab][vc_accordion_tab title="Apply wood conditioner to weathered wood as needed. Apply rust converter to exposed rusted ferrous metal as needed."][vc_column_text]Special AWS wood conditioners are used in areas where wood surfaces are weather damaged and cracked. These conditioners help promote adhesion of top coats and retard the absorption of moisture into the wood. AWS rust converter chemically combines with rust to fight the rust process and actually deters it from progressing.[/vc_column_text][/vc_accordion_tab][vc_accordion_tab title="Apply AWS sealer and/or primer as necessary to home or building."][vc_column_text]Primers and sealers are designed for many different purposes. These include: Adhesion, Stain Blocking, Hiding, and Protection. Different conditions also call for different primers. With Armstrong’s AWS custom system you can be sure your building will receive the right primer for its substrate.[/vc_column_text][/vc_accordion_tab][vc_accordion_tab title="Apply AWS top-coat and/or elastomeric coating to walls and AWS paint to trim."][vc_column_text]Armstrong paints, topcoats and textured coatings are all specified to meet our custom AWS system requirements which include:
<ul>
	<li>100% of all acrylic binders (resin) for unexcelled color retention, exterior weathering and long-term durability</li>
	<li>UV sunblock pigment with T102 (Titanium Dioxide) for long lasting paint film and substrate protection</li>
	<li>High solid content for enhanced paint film build, superior hide and optimum permeability for moisture vapor control</li>
</ul>
Your Armstrong certified superintendent and/or foreman will determine the best combination of application and materials for your home or building.
